I found the part of flowcharting and circut diagrams to be quite difficult conceptually for me. 
I am not one to plan for multiple hours just to work for one hour, and because of that I dont believe I worked well with the planning aspects like the *Flowchart* or the **Circut Diagram**
It defientely doesn't help that I did them after the project, not before, but I digress. 
Still it was a fun project, I would do it again if given the chance, and likely in the same way.
